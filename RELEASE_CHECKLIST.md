# Release Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure all steps are completed before creating a release.

## üöÄ Pre-Release Checklist

### Repository Setup
- [ ] All secrets are configured in GitHub repository:
  - [ ] `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (for PyPI publishing)
  - [ ] `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` (for Test PyPI publishing)
- [ ] GitHub environments are set up (optional but recommended):
  - [ ] `production` environment with required reviewers
  - [ ] `test-pypi` environment for pre-releases
- [ ] Branch protection rules are configured for `main` branch

### Code Quality
- [ ] All tests pass locally: `./scripts/dev.sh test`
- [ ] Code is properly formatted: `./scripts/dev.sh format`
- [ ] Linting passes: `./scripts/dev.sh lint`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `./scripts/dev.sh typecheck`
- [ ] Security scans pass: `./scripts/dev.sh security`
- [ ] No TODO or FIXME comments in critical code paths
- [ ] Documentation is up to date

### Version Management
- [ ] Decide on version number following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
  - **Patch** (1.0.1): Bug fixes only
  - **Minor** (1.1.0): New features, backward compatible
  - **Major** (2.0.0): Breaking changes
  - **Pre-release** (1.0.0-alpha.1): Alpha, beta, or release candidate
- [ ] Update version in `pyproject.toml` if doing manual release
- [ ] Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for better changelog

### Git Preparation
- [ ] Working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Currently on `main` or `master` branch
- [ ] Local branch is up to date with remote: `git pull origin main`
- [ ] All intended changes are merged into main branch

## üìã Release Process

### Option 1: Automated Release (Recommended)

#### Using Release Script
```bash
# Run all checks and prepare release
./scripts/release.sh release 1.0.0

# Or step by step:
./scripts/release.sh check           # Run pre-release checks
./scripts/release.sh prepare 1.0.0   # Prepare release
./scripts/release.sh tag 1.0.0       # Create and push tag
```

#### Manual Tag Creation
```bash
# Create and push version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Option 2: Manual Release (GitHub UI)

1. Go to repository `Actions` tab
2. Select "Release Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter version number (e.g., `1.0.0`)
5. Check "pre-release" if applicable
6. Click "Run workflow"

## üîç Post-Release Verification

### GitHub Actions

- [ ] All jobs passed:
  - [ ] Validate Release
  - [ ] Generate Changelog
  - [ ] Publish to PyPI
  - [ ] Create GitHub Release
  - [ ] Update Documentation (for stable releases)

### PyPI
- [ ] Package is available on PyPI: `https://pypi.org/project/analytics-toolkit/`
- [ ] Package version matches released version
- [ ] Package can be installed: `pip install analytics-toolkit==1.0.0`
- [ ] Package imports correctly: `python -c "import analytics_toolkit; print(analytics_toolkit.__version__)"`

### GitHub Release
- [ ] GitHub release is created: `https://github.com/your-org/analytics-toolkit/releases`
- [ ] Release notes are properly generated
- [ ] Release assets (wheel and source) are attached
- [ ] Pre-release flag is set correctly (if applicable)

### Documentation
- [ ] Documentation is updated (for stable releases)
- [ ] Version numbers in docs match release
- [ ] Installation instructions are correct

## üö® Rollback Procedure

If something goes wrong with the release:

### 1. Quick Fixes
- [ ] Fix issues and create a new patch release
- [ ] Use hotfix process: `./scripts/release.sh hotfix 1.0.1`

### 2. Remove from PyPI (Last Resort)
- [ ] Contact PyPI support to remove package version
- [ ] Note: PyPI generally doesn't allow re-uploading same version

### 3. GitHub Release
- [ ] Edit or delete GitHub release if needed
- [ ] Update release notes with correction information

- [ ] Ensure tokens have appropriate scope

### Version Conflicts
