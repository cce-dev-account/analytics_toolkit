# Minimum complexity grade to show
min = B

# Maximum complexity grade to show
max = F

# Show complexity metrics for:
# - Cyclomatic Complexity (cc)
# - Maintainability Index (mi)
# - Raw metrics (raw)
# - Halstead metrics (hal)

# Average complexity thresholds
# A: 1-5 (low complexity)
# B: 6-10 (moderate complexity)
# C: 11-20 (complex)
# D: 21-50 (very complex)
# E: 51-100 (extremely complex)
# F: >100 (unmaintainable)

# Number of results to show (0 = all)
show = 0

# Sort results by complexity score
sort = true

# Output format options: standard, json, xml
